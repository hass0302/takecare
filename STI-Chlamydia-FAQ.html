                                </li>

                                <li>Anyone who has sex can get chlamydia through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. However,
                                    sexually active young people are at a higher risk of getting chlamydia. This is due to
                                    behaviors and biological factors common among young people. Gay, bisexual, and other
                                    men who have sex with men are also at risk since chlamydia can spread through oral and
                                    anal sex.</li>
                                <li>Have an honest and open talk with your health care provider. Ask whether you should be tested
                                    for chlamydia or other STDs. If you are a sexually active woman younger than 25 years,
                                    you should get a test for chlamydia every year. If you are an older woman with risk factors
                                    such as new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has an STD, you should get
                                    a test for chlamydia every year. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men;
                                    as well as pregnant women should also get tested for chlamydia.</li>

                            <p>Most people who have chlamydia have no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear
                                until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner. Even when chlamydia causes
                                no symptoms, it can damage your reproductive system.</p>

                            <p>Men and women can also get infected with chlamydia in their rectum. This happens either by having
                                receptive anal sex, or by spread from another infected site (such as the vagina). While these
                                infections often cause no symptoms, they can cause</p>

                            <p>Laboratory tests can diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine
                                sample or may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test

                            <p><strong>Yes</strong>, chlamydia can be cured with the right treatment. It is important that you take all of the
                                medication your doctor prescribes to cure your infection. When taken properly it will stop
                                the infection and could decrease your chances of having complications later on. You should
                                not share medication for chlamydia with anyone.</p>
                            <p>Repeat infection with chlamydia is common. You should be tested again about three months after
                                you are treated, even if your sex partner(s) was treated.</p>

                            <p>You should not have sex again until you and your sex partner(s) have completed treatment. If
                                your doctor prescribes a single dose of medication, you should wait seven days after taking
                                the medicine before having sex. If your doctor prescribes a medicine for you to take for
                                seven days, you should wait until you have taken all of the doses before having sex.</p>

                            <p>The initial damage that chlamydia causes often goes unnoticed. However, chlamydia can lead to
                                serious health problems.</p>
                            <p>If you are a woman, untreated chlamydia can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes (tubes
                                that carry fertilized eggs from the ovaries to the uterus). This can cause pelvic inflammatory
                                disease (PID). PID often has no symptoms, however some women may have abdominal and pelvic
                                pain. Even if it doesn’t cause symptoms initially, PID can cause permanent damage to your
                                reproductive system. PID can lead to long-term pelvic pain, inability to get pregnant, and
                                potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus).</p>
                            <p>Men rarely have health problems linked to chlamydia. Infection sometimes spreads to the tube
                                that carries sperm from the testicles, causing pain and fever. Rarely, chlamydia can prevent
                                a man from being able to have children.</p>
                            <p>Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV – the virus that
                                causes AIDS.</p>
